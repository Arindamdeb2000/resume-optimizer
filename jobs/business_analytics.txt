Business Analytics Specialist

This is an analytic position that bridges the worlds of Business Analytics, Management Accounting and 
Data Visualization. 
 
Do you like to play with financial data? Do you like to create data rich graphics that engage people? Do 
you like producing reports that result in action? Our ideal candidate will enjoy organizing financial and 
related data, using data to create decision-support tools, as well as create a variety of reports and innovative 
dashboards and visual management tools.  While an understanding of underlying financial transactions is 
crucial, the focus of the position will be the distillation and presentation of the financial information to 
operations staff, project managers and decision-makers.  The position will also maintain and improve the 
underlying data structure in the Oracle EBS Project Module to facilitate downstream use of the data.   
 
Excellent communication and collaboration skills will allow this position to discuss and understand the real 
information needs of a variety of colleagues:  project managers, operations staff, financial staff and division 
management.  Once the needs are understood, the candidate will do the necessary data mining, and develop 
appropriate analytics to address the need.  The successful candidate will be able to apply excellent 
"translation" skills to then interpret dashboards and analytics for a wide variety of users. 
 
We are looking for an employee who is energized when confronted by steep learning curves and deep dives 
into the analysis of complex financial and operational information.
